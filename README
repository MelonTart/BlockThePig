# BlockThePig
This project attepmts to beat the game of Block The Pig.
This was accomplished using two different methods,
recursive solving and neural networks. The recursive
solution attempts to simualte the game as closely as possible
in which moves are recusively tested until one beats that round.
The AI neural network aproach uses a neural network that is
trained by playing the game without iterfenece using
reinforcement training techniques
